## SkinCheck : A personalized skin cancer classifier web app backed by a convolutional neural network (CNN) model and a questionnaire-based assessment to assist patients where each patient would have access to a skin cancer specialist.

*SkinCheck during its ideation and initial prototype phase (in the AGBI Digital HealthTech Grand Challenge) was imagined as a personalized skin cancer assistant that would help would in early diagnosis and will assist dermatologists in making efficient customized treatment plans.*

### Features:
*  1- Classification of type of skin cancer 
*  2- Questionnaire-based assessment of skin cancer 
*  3- Popular online resources and forums regarding skin cancer 

### Features to be added in the future:
*  1- Contacting skin cancer specialists based on geographical locations 
*  2- A premium feature including consultation with doctors through a text based interface 
*  3- An app including all the features

### Details on building upon project after the campaign is over :

 *We will work on developing a dataset for classifying skin cancer and non-skin cancer images. As of now, our idea is limited to cancer patients only but we want to expand it to the general public so that anyone having doubts about a suspicious skin patch can use our application for self-diagnosis. Other useful features will be integrated to make our application more robust and user friendly like a system for continuous monitoring of a skin lesion. An AI-enabled system to increase the resolution and quality of the image for the deep learning model to classify them more accurately.*
